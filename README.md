Project name: Readme-Generator

Description
The purpose of this project was to create a Readme Generator that will allow the user to create a professional README.md file for their project. This will help the user save time and focus on the project itself.

I created a branch for this project to get in the habit of writing code off of the main branch. I believe this will help me as I work on teams in the future. 
As a new learner in coding, I was having issues with understanding how to use node.js, inquirer and the terminal all together. This project helped me practice and learn more about node.js, markup, and inquirer.
