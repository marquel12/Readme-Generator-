The goal of this project was to create a high quality Readme file. This would essentially allow developers to use the Readme-Generator to so they can focus more on build projects. 
As a new learner in coding this was a challegne for me. But this allowed me to learn more about node.js, markdown, the terminal, and how to use inquirer. 
If you're wondering why most files show as .copy, this is because I took the start code given from rutgers bootcamp to build the project.
I forgot to rename the files, rookie mistake!
