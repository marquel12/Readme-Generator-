The goal of this project was to create a high quality Readme file. This would essentially allow developers to use the Readme-Generator so they can focus more on building projects. 
As a new learner in coding this was a challegne for me. But this allowed me to learn more about node.js, markdown, the terminal, and how to use inquirer. 
I created a new branch for this project to help me get in the habit of working off the main branch. 
If you're wondering why most files show as .copy, this is because I took the start code given from rutgers bootcamp to build the project.
I forgot to rename the files, rookie mistake!

Here is a screen shot of the terminal and VSCode:
